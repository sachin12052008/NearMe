    <h2>
        The Arulmigu Kailasanathar temple is very significant due to its significance as the only temple with a 5-tier
        Rajagopuram, to its advanced state through the still unique gold-plated threshold, as well as the Vanni tree as
        it's sthala viruksham etc.<br>
        Festival celebrations are still important, apparent in the holding of 63 Nayanmars festival, as well as the
        Nithya Sumangali Mariamman temple festival which is celebrated in the month of Aippasi, etc...
